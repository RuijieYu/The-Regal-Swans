## Preparetions

However,
since only private notebooks can have access to the
database, the audience should fork this notebook (to make it
a private notebook) and then add the CPDB data source under

## Part 1

Under the section &ldquo;**Part 1**&rdquo;, there are two sets of radio

directly or use the slide bar to interactively put in the
desired years of employment. The graph below is the output.
