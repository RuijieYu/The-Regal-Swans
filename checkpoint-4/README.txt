Questions:

Is there any “use of force contagion” between officers that share activities with each other?

Are certain groups of officers are more likely to incur civilian allegations than others, regardless of number of allegations?

To run this code:

In order to run this code, all you need to do is run this code in google Colab or any other environment that supports iPy Notebooks. If the code is not running for you (In particular you are receiving an error that the Python API of Graphframes is not found), then likely you need to upload the graphframes jar file specifically to the jars folder in spark, found on the right hand bar. I have attached the correct jar just in case.
